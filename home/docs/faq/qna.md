# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Will I get banned if I use this launcher?
**A: Short answer, not likely.**

Our team always try our best to mimic what the official launcher and the games do to its file and configurations (except any feature that is labeled as "Experimental"). We also absolutely do not do any game hooking, direct memory read/write to the game process, and any assets/game files modification out of the scope for what the game needs to run.

Our team have not receive any report of account banning for strictly using Collapse Launcher as their preferred launcher of choice at the moment.

::: tip
