# Collapse Launcher - Documentation Website

Contrary to the launcher itself, this repository serves as the official documentation platform for it. While we're not asking our users to read through the code, we've exposed it should anyone feel the need to peruse it to make improvements, or just for fun.

### System Requirements
To run a local copy of the website, the user must have the following dependencies:

- OS: Windows, Mac OS X or Linux distribution which is still actively supported 
- Node: version 20 or higher

If submitting changes:

- Code editor of some sorts (VSCode or anything similar)
- Git

Run the page locally:
```
npm install
npm run home:dev
```

Please make sure to test if the application builds locally before pushing any changes, by running the command below :) : 
```
npm run home:build
```
